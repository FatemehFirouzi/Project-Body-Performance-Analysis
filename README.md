# Project-Body-Performance-Analysis
The objective of this project is to develop a multi-classification model which is able to predict performance based on health indicators.
## Introduction
This is my master project aimed at data understanding and developing a multi-classification model which is able to predict performance based on health indicators, using Python. I looked at health factors such as age, blood pressure, height, weight, body fat percentage  and how they are related to overall body performance. Creating a successful model could help athletes identify the most important factors that affect their performance and focus on these factors.   
## Dataset overview
This Body Performance Data covers the fitness tracker measurement data provided by the Seoul Olympic National Sports Agency. It was loaded into the Jupyter Notebook, where Python programming language was used to analyze the data. The data set consists of 13 393 rows and 12 columns with 10 numerical and 2 categorical features.
## Summary
I examined a dataset containing numerous health and exercise indicators that could affect performance of an athlete:
- Some factors like blood pressure and gender may not be influential factors for determining performance. 
- The gender may not be influential, considering that on average men tend to perform better than women on similar sport tasks. 
- A classification algorithm was developed which was able to make correct predictions in 73 % of the cases. 
- Getting  around 73 % accuracy, means there is some unidentified factor that influences the body performance of an athlete.
- Some potential health factors worth exploring are hormone levels (like testosterone,  estrogen and cortisol), mental health state, vitamin levels and the ratio of carbohydrates, proteins and fats in an athlete's diet. 
- Other factors related to exercise worth exploring could be more dynamical like the time to travel a specified distance, throwing a javelin or a heavy ball and the average high interval intensity training score.
